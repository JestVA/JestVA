# I edited Wikipedia, once..

"Why is `v7` the only point not included in an area `e`?" I asked in the [London Algorithms](https://www.meetup.com/London-Algorithms-Meetup/) Slack channel.

"Well that's a good question. An additional one would be why the incidence PAOH below shows v7 in an edge but the diagram doesn't. One of them is wrong!"

"Anyone can edit Wikipedia :wink:"

And off I went. A couple hours later I had edited the [Hypergraph theory page on Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph).

Was I a graphing algorithm expert? Far from it... 

But I'm an expert in intellectual curiosity. I find it the root of progress. 

Knowledge for the sake of understanding, for the love of knowledge. Simply put, `Philo sofia`.

## Dear reader: 

ðŸ”° If you are a developer (you'd benefit most out of it, but also if you are a BA, Product Owner, Designer etc.), join one of my [meetup series in London](https://www.meetup.com/London-Algorithms-Meetup/events/hwnsfsyccfbqb/) (currently remote). Besides the [curriculum](https://github.com/JestVA/DevUnwind) I also have other [talks (e.g. Dealing with Time in Javascript)](https://github.com/JestVA/talks).

ðŸ”° If you feel too burdened or affraid of getting burnt out, see if you can find the support and reconciliation that you need in my [Developer Happiness support chatroom](https://gitter.im/DevUnwind/community).

ðŸ”° If you want to collaborate in OSS projects with me, [raise an issue here](https://github.com/JestVA/DevUnwind) and I will make sure to read it. It also gets posted via a webhook on the [Gitter](https://gitter.im/DevUnwind/community) group

ðŸ”° If you want to hang out and chat more technical bits, please join my [Discord](https://discord.gg/yXEK9udCSz). This link is just for you and will never expire

Sometimes I might live code, stream electronic music or even write literature like this piece on [Materialisation, olives and philosophers](https://vocal.media/humans/witchfully-yours), *live* on my [Twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/devfrend). 

Oftentimes I post fun memes on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/memedvlpr).

I work from a container in East London. Some of the stuff I create is posted on the [Galois.ai Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/galois.ai/) (Wolfram Automatas and State Machines)
