# I edited Wikipedia, once..

"Why is `v7` the only point not included in an area `e`?" I asked in the [London Algorithms](https://www.meetup.com/London-Algorithms-Meetup/) Slack channel.

"Well that's a good question. An additional one would be why the incidence PAOH below shows v7 in an edge but the diagram doesn't. One of them is wrong!"

"Anyone can edit Wikipedia :wink:"

And off I went. A couple hours later I had edited the [Hypergraph theory page on Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph).

Was I a graphing algorithm expert? Far from it... 

But I'm an expert in intellectual curiosity. I find it the root of progress. 

Knowledge for the sake of understanding, for the love of knowledge. Simply put, `Philo sofia`.
