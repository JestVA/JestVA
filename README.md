# The story of how I, once, edited Wikipedia

I asked in the [London Algorithms](https://www.meetup.com/London-Algorithms-Meetup/) Slack channel why `v7` is the only point not included in area `e`. 

The response was that it's a good question and that there is another question to consider, which is why the incidence `PAOH` shows `v7` in an edge but the diagram doesn't.

One of them is incorrect. 

Someone mentioned that anyone can edit Wikipedia and I decided to edit the [Hypergraph theory page on Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph). 

Although I am not an expert in graphing algorithms, I still wanted to contribute.

I find intellectual curiosity the root of progress. And this is how I keep sharp!
